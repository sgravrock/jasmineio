#Jasmine.Io
**A Io Language Testing Framework**

Jasmine.Io is a [Io Language](http://www.iolanguage.com) port of the popular Behavior Driven Development testing framework for JavaScript.

## Abandonment ##

Please see [the upstream repo](https://github.com/bekkopen/jasmineio), which is still active, if you're interested in Jasmine.Io. I'm no longer working with Jasmine.Io or writing any other Io code. I'm not convinced that closure-driven BDD frameworks are a good fit for the way Io works, but it's there if you want to use it.

I'm keeping this fork up just in case any of the experiments I've got on branches are of interest to anyone.
